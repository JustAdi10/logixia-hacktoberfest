# Contributing to Logixia

🎉 **Welcome to Logixia!** We're excited that you're interested in contributing to our advanced logging library for Node.js and TypeScript applications.

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Logixia as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## 🎃 Hacktoberfest 2025

We're participating in **Hacktoberfest 2025**! This is a great opportunity for new contributors to get involved.

### For Hacktoberfest Contributors:
- Look for issues labeled with `hacktoberfest` and `good first issue`
- Read this entire contributing guide before starting
- Join our community discussions for help and guidance
- Quality over quantity - we value meaningful contributions
- All skill levels welcome - from documentation to complex features

### Hacktoberfest Guidelines:
- **No spam PRs** - Low-quality PRs will be marked as `spam` or `invalid`
- **Follow our standards** - Ensure your code meets our quality requirements
- **Test your changes** - All PRs must include appropriate tests
- **Be patient** - Maintainers will review PRs as quickly as possible

## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/Logixia/logixia/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Logixia/logixia/issues/new); it's that easy!

### 🐛 Bug Report Template
When reporting bugs, please include:
- **Environment**: Node.js version, OS, package version
- **Steps to reproduce**: Clear, numbered steps
- **Expected behavior**: What should happen
- **Actual behavior**: What actually happens
- **Code sample**: Minimal reproducible example
- **Error messages**: Full error stack traces

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
